            <p> <span>The Onewheel is not a toy!</span> Like most board sports the onewheel can cause injuries, some due to the users and others due to environmental or techniqcal isues. It it therefore recommended to learn about the safety features of the borad and wear the appropriate safety gear to prevent injuries. Through the guilde we will not only teach the user how to ride, but how to do it safely to minimise the chance of harm. </p>

            <h2>Protective Gear</h2>
            <p>When it comes to board sport the safety gear is fairly the same. The bare minimum a rider should have is a good helmet, althought that alone wouldn't help during a fall. As an instint when we fall we tend to raise our wrist to protect oursleves, therefore having a wrist guard is essential. Other protective gear to include are elbow and knee guards which are good to have esspecially when first starting out learning to ride. Here is a offical Future motion safety video:</p>

        <h2>Lets get started</h2>
        <div class="lets-go-media-outer">
            <h3>Getting on/off the board</h3>
            <p>Similar to any board sport its important to find out which is your domminent foot, and thats what you want on the back foot pad. The front foot pad is the one that has 2 sensors and your foot would need to cover both sides to engage the board. As you place both feet on the board and lift up the board will engage and balance. Disengagiing the board requires you to lift you front foot of one side of the sensor pad which then bring the nose down. The videos bellow describe how to do so:</p>

            <h3>foot position and stance</h3>
            <p>By now you know which is your prefered foot placement, the next step is to find out how placing your feet on different places on the board affects your control. Jake from the Float Life explains in great detail on this:</p>

            <h3>Accelerating, braking and reversing</h3>
            <p>Body movement is the key. Hip movement is the main way to accelerate and reverse on the board, it allows you to keep your head above the wheel which gives you the best balance. Toe and heel movement is how you trun like with any other board sport along side having your arms up to aid you balance. The bellow videos expand more on this:</p>

            <h3>Pushback/nosedive</h3>
            <p>This is the main safety feature of the board, it is there to prevent the rider from getting seriously hurt by over estimating the boards ability. Like all e-vehicles theonewheel has its limits and understanding the is important to keep you from damaging the board and most importantly yourself. </p>

            <h3>Patiance and practice</h3>
            <p>Everyone has different experiences with the onewheel, some pick it up naturally and with others it takes time. However, with patient and practice you'll start to build confidence and gain the muscle memory to comfortably ride better with each instance.</p>
