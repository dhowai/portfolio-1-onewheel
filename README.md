-   ### Design
    -   ### Color Scheme
        -   The main color was taken using a eye dropper site called eyedropper.org to get a shade of orange from the main landing page image. Then using mycolor.space I got a pallette of accompining colors. 
        -   I used the #2F4858 color for the main headings and body text, #F5874E for the hover element, #7D5D90 for the warning section, #E46974 for the submit button on the enquiry page.
        ![Color Pallette](https://github.com/dhowai/portfolio-1-onewheel/blob/master/assets/images/readme%20photos/Palette.png)
    -   ### Typography
        -   The Cairo font was used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font. Cairo is simple and clean font and it loosely resembles the Onewheel logo font which made it the appropriate choice.
    -   ### Imagery
        -   Each page beside the form enquiry has a background here image of people using the product. Each one is in a different setting which catches the user's attention, that this board can be used in different settings.

## Testing

Opening section about how the site is functional

Bugs/problems encountered

One of the issues encountered were the use of images for the maintenance page, which were amazon listing picture. These images came with white backgrounds which did not esthically correct with the css for the table. After extensive research I found a site that has a tool which automtically removes the white backgrounds of these images. This saved time in the long run if i intended to work with the images by changing the css styling. 

Had a problem with align the home page images side by side. The images ended up lining vertically and could not figure out how to align them horizontally. I had to check online and came across a how to page done by w3schools which showed them acheiving the desired outcome by using display flex and a flex of 33.33% due to it being 3 images. Ended up coming back to w3schools for more tutorials.

Initially the website/company name was called the floaters guide to onewheel. When it came to lowering the screen resolution the tittle apeared to be too long and it effected the nav links. I decided to shorten the name and add the full one above the hero image. Due to the fact I already had an animation on the hero image the text was also getting affectted and was moving out of place at lower resolution screen. The solution I came up with was to remove most of the css for the text position and leave in the transform and translate the text near the middle of the image. This change made the text fixed in one position with the animation at different screen resolutions.
