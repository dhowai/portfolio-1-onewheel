-   ### Design
    -   ### Color Scheme
        -   The main color was taken using an eye dropper site called eyedropper.org to get a shade of orange from the main landing page image. Then using mycolor.space I got a palette of accompanying colors. 
        -   I used the #2F4858 color for the main headings and body text, #F5874E for the hover element, #7D5D90 in the warning section, #E46974 for the submit button on the enquiry page.
        ![Color Pallette](https://github.com/dhowai/portfolio-1-onewheel/blob/master/assets/images/readme%20photos/Palette.png)
    -   ### Typography
        -   The Cairo font for the headings was used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font. Cairo is simple and clean font and it loosely resembles the Onewheel logo font which made it the appropriate choice.
        -   Rubik was used as the body text because it accompanies Cairo well with Sans-Serif as a backup.
    -   ### Imagery
        -   Each page beside the form enquiry has a background here image of people using the product. Each one is in a different setting which catches the user's attention, that this board can be used in different settings.

### Features left to implement

-   A button that allows the user to jump back to the top of the page instead of scrolling.
-   Or to fix the nav bar on the side on top without interfering with the content.
-   Some possible feature that comes from user feedback through the enquiry form. 

## Testing

### Functional Testing

-    Navigation Bar
    -   The nav bar stays on the top tight and is evenly spaced and visible..
    -   As the screen size gets lower the nav bar moves under the main log and reduces line-spacing and font-size to fill the screen.
    -   Tried to get the nav bar to stick to the right as the user moved down the screen, but it interfered with the content.
    -   Would try to implement Javascript in the future to achieve that or have a back to top button.

-   Footer
    -   The social media links are located in the footer and are on all pages.
    -   The social media icons change color as the mouse hovers over, letting the user know which one is being selected and open in a new tab.
    -   The spacing between the icons move closer and get smaller as the resolution gets smaller.

-   Hero Images
    -   The hero images have a background around the text or on the actual image to make the text more visible.
    -   As the resolution gets smaller the images height gets reduced by half to fit smaller screens and the text gets reduced in size.

-   The media (Pictures/videos)
    -   All the media on the site responds to changes in resolution.
    -   The images reduced in size keeping the small image ratio as the screen gets smaller.
    
-   The text content
    -   The Paragraphs have specific CSS that positions the text in the middle of the screen with equal padding on both sides of the screen.
    -   This allows the users to focus on the content in the middle without looking at each end of the screen to read the sentences.
    -   As the resolution reduces the text gets smaller and the content remains in the middle of the screen.

-   How to page, iframe
    -   The Iframes used on the how to page are responsive in a 16:9 ratio,
    -   As the screen resolution reduces the Iframe adjust in proportion to the aspect ratio.
    -   However, at larger screens the Iframe media are large and makes scrolling an issue.

-   The maintenance page
    -   The lets get cleaning section has steps with text and an accompanying GIF.
    -   The inital style allows the media to respond better when the screen resolution reduces, however, at larger screens the media is not equal distance from each other and wasn't aesthetically pleasing. 
    -   Each step is inline and parallel with the other media by adjusting the width so solve the above issue.
    -   This causes the media to move closer together at lower resolution screens, therefore a media query was placed at 950px which removes the width style and allows the media to line up better.

-   The Gallery page
    -   This page has images of the float community.    
    -   As the screen resolution reduces the column count reduces from 3 to 2 to 1. Allowing for a better viewing experience.
